Basic modalities are described from a psychological, ergonomic and technical point of view. This includes reviewing the working of basic interaction techniques such as keyboard, mouse, pointing, touch, speech, displays, acoustics and haptics. Interface design is addressed through methods and principles presenting graphical user interfaces and direct manipulation, menus, navigation, up to multimodal interfaces.  User modeling is treated through cognitive, experiential and social models of users and task analysis culminating in computational models of users to be included in interactive systems. Social computing and computer supported cooperative work are introduced with basics of collaboration and related theories of computer mediated communication. The course includes teaching of prototyping, evaluation and experimentation approaches.

Such a system can be considered intelligent or adaptive when it somehow learns from previous operation or user interaction and modifies its present of future behaviour accordingly. In this course, each participant designs, implements, and evaluates an intelligent embedded system of their choice through independent study. There are neither joint sessions nor examinations.

In this course, we first review existing literature on usability considerations for the design of such interfaces. Then each participant, either individually or in small teams, designs and implements an augmented-reality user interface, after which we review methods for usability evaluation and particularly user experiments. Then, the participants design, carry out, and document a usability evaluation on their prototype, reporting their findings. It is recommended, although not mandatory, to participate in the seminar on Augmented Reality (58313306) in the Fall term 2013; other previous experience of AR-technologies will compensate for not taking the seminar. For the practical assignments, it is recommended to continue with the case studies of the seminar to save time on the prototype implementation.'),(17,'Service-Oriented Software Engineering','Service-oriented software engineering (SOSE) is a software engineering approach which utilises constructs and concepts conforming with the service-oriented computing paradigm for designing, modelling and developing service based systems. The course introduces principles behind service-oriented software engineering, and approaches and methods for efficient service production in service ecosystems. The emphasis of the course is on service design, composition and modelling principles instead of specific implementation technologies.'),(18,'Deterministic Distributed Algorithms','The course gives an introduction to the theory of distributed algorithms. The topics include algorithmic techniques that can be used to solve graph problems efficiently in extremely large networks, as well as fundamental impossibility results that put limitations on distributed computing. No prior knowledge of distributed systems is needed, but students are expected to have an interest in algorithmic problems and a basic knowledge of discrete mathematics.

Subsequent lectures will cover hardware and software platform security techniques and usability aspects of mobile platform security in particular and mobile security in general. The course will include optional programming assignments. A group of students will be assigned to take notes during each lecture and produce a cleaned up lecture notes for each lecture. Optionally, each student can produce a short paper describing a platform security problem they would like on. This will be the basis for a subsequent special assignment for extra credit. Evaluation will be based on homework exercises and lecture notes. Successfully completed programming assignments will give an extra credit. There will be no exam.'),(28,'Unsupervised Machine Learning Projects','Practical implementation of methods taught in the course Unsupervised Machine Learning, in a number of short computer projects.
